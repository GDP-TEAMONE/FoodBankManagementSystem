Allergen and Nutritional Information 

1) Storing and Displaying Information:
* Database: Implement a comprehensive database to store detailed allergen and nutritional information for each food item.
Standardized Format: Utilize standardized formats like GPC Allergen Labeling or USDA National Nutrient Database for Standards Reference for consistency and accuracy.

* User-Friendly Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for staff to easily enter, edit, and access information.
Item-Specific Details: Capture specific details like ingredients, potential cross-contamination risks, and presence of major allergens (Big 8: Milk, Eggs, Peanuts, Tree Nuts, Soy, Wheat, Fish, Shellfish).

* Nutritional Profile: Include macronutrients (calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), and any relevant dietary information (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
Searchable Database: Enable searching and filtering by allergens, ingredients, nutritional content, dietary restrictions, etc.

2. Alerts for Allergen Concerns:
* Real-time Alerts: Develop an alert system that flags potential allergen concerns during distribution based on recipient profiles.
* Recipient Profiles: Allow recipients to input their allergen restrictions and preferences when registering or receiving assistance.
* Matching System: Create an automated system that matches recipient profiles with food items, highlighting potential allergen conflicts.
* Visual Cues: Utilize color-coding, symbols, or other visual cues to clearly communicate allergen information on food packaging or distribution lists.
* Staff Training: Train staff on identifying and managing allergen risks, using the alert system effectively, and communicating sensitively with recipients

Tracking Expiry Dates

1. Monitoring and Flagging:
* Item Entry: Require entry of expiry dates during food donation or inventory addition.
* Inventory Management: Develop a system to track expiry dates for all food items in inventory.
* Color Coding: Implement a color-coded system to visually identify items nearing or exceeding expiry (e.g., green for fresh, yellow for approaching, red for expired).

* Customizable Filters: Allow filtering inventory based on expiry date range for targeted prioritization.

2. Automatic Removal from Inventory:
* Pre-set Threshold: Define a threshold for automatic removal (e.g., 2 days before expiry).
* Confirmation Mechanism: Implement a confirmation step before automatic removal to prevent accidental deletion.
* Reporting and Logs: Maintain detailed logs of removed items, including date, reason, and quantity.
