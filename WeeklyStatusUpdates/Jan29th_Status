Allergen and Nutritional Information 

1) Storing and Displaying Information:
* Database: Implement a comprehensive database to store detailed allergen and nutritional information for each food item.
Standardized Format: Utilize standardized formats like GPC Allergen Labeling or USDA National Nutrient Database for Standards Reference for consistency and accuracy.

* User-Friendly Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for staff to easily enter, edit, and access information.

Searchable Database: Enable searching and filtering by allergens, ingredients, nutritional content, dietary restrictions, etc.

2. Alerts for Allergen Concerns:
* Real-time Alerts: Develop an alert system that flags potential allergen concerns during distribution based on recipient profiles.
* Recipient Profiles: Allow recipients to input their allergen restrictions and preferences when registering or receiving assistance.
* Matching System: Create an automated system that matches recipient profiles with food items, highlighting potential allergen conflicts.
* Visual Cues: Utilize color-coding, symbols, or other visual cues to clearly communicate allergen information on food packaging or distribution lists.
* Staff Training: Train staff on identifying and managing allergen risks, using the alert system effectively, and communicating sensitively with recipients
