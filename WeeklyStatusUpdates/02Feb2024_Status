Integration Design for Food bank management system:
Here, we are going to talk about the design part for the database that we are using for this project. Manily we will focus on the
design part for each departments like donation management, volunteer management etc.

Designing the database tables for user registration and profiles involves creating a structured schema to efficiently manage 
information related to various user roles such as food donors, recipients, volunteers, and administrators. The goal is to 
capture essential user account details and create comprehensive user profiles with personal and contact information. Here are 
key considerations for designing the tables:
1) User Table:
Create a central "User" table to store common attributes like UserID, UserType (donor, recipient, volunteer, administrator), Username, Password, and RegistrationDate.
Utilize UserType to distinguish between different user roles.

2) UserProfile Table:
Design a "UserProfile" table linked to the "User" table via the UserID as a foreign key.
Include attributes such as ProfileID, FirstName, LastName, Email, ContactNumber, and Address in the "UserProfile" table.
This one-to-one relationship ensures that each user has a corresponding profile.
