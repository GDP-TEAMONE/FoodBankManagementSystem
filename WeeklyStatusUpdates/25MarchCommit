Here's a proposed list of prototypes to be provided by the end of the semester:

 User Registration and Profiles:
1. User Accounts: Implement user accounts for food donors, recipients, volunteers, and administrators.
2. User Profiles: Create user profiles containing personal and contact details.

Donation Management:
1. Donor Registration: Allow donors to register and create profiles.
2. Donation Entry: Enable the entry of donation details such as quantity, type, and expiration dates.
3. Receipt Generation: Implement automatic generation of donation receipts.

Inventory Management:
1. Centralized Database: Develop a centralized database for tracking food inventory in real time.
2. Categorization and Labeling: Implement categorization and labeling of food items for efficient organization.
3. Alerts: Set up alerts for low stock levels and upcoming expirations.

Recipient Registration and Eligibility:
1. Registration Process: Provide a registration process for individuals or families seeking food assistance.
2. Eligibility Criteria: Define criteria and verification processes for determining eligibility.

Distribution Planning:
1. Planning Tools: Develop tools for planning and scheduling food distribution events.
2. Optimization Features: Implement optimization features for efficient distribution routes.
3. Integration with Mapping Services: Integrate with mapping services for route planning.

 Backup and Recovery:
1. Automated Backups: Set up regular automated backups of the database.
2. Data Recovery Procedures: Define procedures for data recovery in case of system failures.

 Feedback Mechanism:
1. Feedback System: Develop a system for collecting feedback from donors, recipients, and volunteers to improve operations.
2. Surveys or Rating Systems: Implement surveys or rating systems for users to provide input.


Order Processing:
1. Order Creation: Create and manage food distribution orders.
2. Prioritization: Prioritize orders based on urgency or specific criteria.

Reporting and Analytics:
1. Report Generation: Generate reports on donations, distributions, and inventory levels.
2. Analytics Tools  : Develop analytics tools to identify trends, plan for future needs, and assess impact.

Volunteer Management:
1. Volunteer Registration: Allow volunteers to register and create profiles.
2. Scheduling Tools: Provide scheduling tools for recruiting, assigning, and tracking volunteer activities.
3. Volunteer Profiles:Create volunteer profiles with skills and availability.

Communication Module:
1. Notification System: Implement a notification system for donors, volunteers, and recipients (e.g., email, SMS).
2. Internal Communication: Develop internal communication tools for staff and volunteers.

The notification system aims to implement a communication channel for donors, volunteers, and recipients through methods like email and SMS. 
This system will facilitate timely updates and alerts related to food donations, distributions, and volunteer activities

Integration with External Systems:
1. **Financial Systems:** Ensure compatibility with financial systems for donation tracking and reporting.
2. **Government Databases:** Integrate with government databases for eligibility verification.

Allergen and Nutritional Information:
1. **Information Storage:** Implement capability to store and display allergen and nutritional information for food items.
2. **Alerts:** Set up alerts for potential allergen concerns during distribution.

Scalability:
1. System Scalability: Ensure the system can handle increased data and user load as the food bank expands.

User-Friendly Interface:
1. Intuitive Interface: Develop an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for all user types.
2. Training and Support: Provide training materials and support for staff and volunteers.

Tracking Expiry Dates:
1. Expiration Monitoring: Develop a system to monitor and flag food items approaching or exceeding expiration dates.
2. Automatic Removal: Implement automatic removal of expired items from inventory.

By providing these prototypes, we aim to create a comprehensive and efficient Food Bank System that enhances the management of food donations, distributions, and volunteer efforts. This proposed list will be linked from the main page of the repository to serve as the agreement between the developer and the mentor regarding the expected prototypes to be developed by the end of the class.
