Functional requirements in a project define the specific features and functionalities that a system or product must possess 
to meet the needs of its users. They outline what the system should do, rather than how it will do it (which is addressed by
technical requirements). Here's a breakdown of key aspects of functional requirements:

1. User Accounts and Profiles

User Types:
Donors: Individuals or organizations donating food items.
Recipients: Individuals or families seeking food assistance.
Volunteers: Individuals offering their time and skills to support the food bank.
Administrators: Authorized personnel managing the system and user accounts.
Registration:
An online registration process for all user types, including secure login credentials creation.
Profiles:
Each user type should have a dedicated profile page for managing personal and contact information.
Donors: Details like name, organization (if applicable), contact information, and preferred donation methods.
Recipients: Information like name, household size, dietary restrictions, and proof of eligibility documents.
Volunteers: Name, contact information, availability schedule, and skill sets.
Administrators: Additional privileges for system configuration and user management.

2. Donation Management
Donor Registration and Profile: (Refer to User Accounts and Profiles)
Donation Entry:
A user-friendly interface for donors to enter donation details.
Required fields:

Quantity of donated items.
Type of food items (dropdown list with categories like canned goods, produce, dairy, etc.).
Expiration date of the donated items.
Optional fields:
Brand name of the items.
Special instructions (e.g., storage requirements).
Ability to upload photos of the donation for reference.
Automatic Donation Receipts:
The system should automatically generate and email donation receipts to donors upon successful entry.
Receipts should include:
Donor information.
Donated item details (quantity, type, expiration date).
Date and time of donation.
Food bank contact information.

3. Inventory Management
Centralized Database:
A real-time database to track all food items received as donations.
Categorization and Labeling:
Functionality to categorize food items by type (canned goods, produce, etc.) for efficient organization.
Enable barcoding or QR code generation for each item for tracking purposes.
Inventory Alerts:
System should generate alerts for low stock levels of specific food items.
Alerts for items approaching expiration dates to prevent wastage.

4. Recipient Registration and Eligibility
Registration Process:
An online registration process for individuals or families seeking food assistance.
Capturing relevant information like household size, dietary restrictions, and emergency contact details.
Eligibility Criteria:
Define clear eligibility criteria for receiving food assistance (e.g., income level, proof of residence).
Develop a verification process to ensure eligibility before user activation.

5. Distribution Planning
Event Planning Tools:
A calendar interface for scheduling and managing food distribution events.
Ability to define event details like location, time, and volunteer needs.
Optimization Features:
Algorithms to optimize distribution routes for efficiency, considering factors like recipient locations and volunteer availability.
Mapping Integration:
Integrate with mapping services like Google Maps to create optimized delivery routes and generate directions for volunteers.

6. Order Processing
Food Distribution Orders:
Functionality to create and manage food distribution orders for recipients.
Orders should be based on recipient needs and available inventory.
Order Prioritization:
Develop a system to prioritize orders based on urgency (e.g., dietary restrictions) or specific criteria defined by the food bank.

7. Reporting and Analytics
Reports Generation:
The system should generate comprehensive reports on various aspects:
Donation trends (quantity, type of food items).
Distribution statistics (number of recipients served, food distributed).
Inventory levels over time.
Analytics Tools:
Provide data visualization tools to identify trends and patterns in donations, distributions, and recipient needs.
Utilize these insights to forecast future needs and optimize food bank operations.

8. Volunteer Management
Volunteer Registration and Profile: (Refer to User Accounts and Profiles)
Scheduling Tools:
Implement a scheduling system for assigning volunteers to specific tasks and events.
Allow volunteers to view their schedules and update availability.
Volunteer Profiles:
Volunteer profiles should capture skills and availability to match them with suitable tasks.

9. Notification System:
Implement a notification system to keep users informed:
Donors: Receive notifications about donation receipts and upcoming distribution events.
Recipients: Be notified about their eligibility status, order confirmation, and upcoming food distribution details (location, time).
Volunteers: Get notified about assigned tasks, schedule updates, and important announcements.
The system should offer multiple notification channels for user preference (e.g., email, SMS).

Internal Communication Tools:
Establish secure communication channels for staff and volunteers to collaborate effectively.
Options could include:
Internal chat platform.
Forum for discussions and knowledge sharing.
Announcement boards for system updates and important information.

10. Mobile Accessibility
Responsive Design or Mobile App:
Develop a responsive website design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Alternatively, consider building a dedicated mobile app for user convenience.
The mobile platform should offer easy access to key functionalities like:
Profile management.
Donation tracking (for donors).
Order management and scheduling (for recipients).
Volunteer task management and communication.
