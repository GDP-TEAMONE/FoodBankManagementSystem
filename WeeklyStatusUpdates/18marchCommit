Non-Functional requirments:-

Performance:

Speedy Actions, Timely Reports, Steady Growth:

Users should experience near-instantaneous responses (within 3 seconds) for most interactions.
Generating reports shouldn't take an eternity - aim for completion within 10 minutes.
The system should handle a significant increase in users (20% more) without slowing down.
This ensures a smooth and efficient user experience. Reports are generated quickly, providing valuable information when needed. The system can grow alongside your food bank's needs, preventing performance issues as user numbers rise.

Availability and Data Integrity:

Minimal Downtime: We aim for the system to be available at least 99.9% of the time, with planned maintenance periods for updates.
Regular Backups: Automatic, daily backups of all data will be conducted, ensuring a safety net for at least 30 days in case of issues.
Error Handling Like a Boss: The system will be equipped to gracefully handle unexpected errors, preventing data loss and minimizing service interruptions.
These measures guarantee a reliable system that food banks and clients can depend on.  Your valuable data will be safeguarded against unforeseen circumstances, and robust error handling will prevent problems from snowballing.  In short, this system is built to be resilient and keep your food bank running smoothly.

This section emphasizes the robust security measures in place to protect sensitive information:

Locked Down Data: All sensitive details, like donor information and volunteer profiles, will be encrypted at rest (when stored) and in transit (when being sent). 
This means even if someone intercepts the data, they won't be able to access it.
Access with Permission Only: A role-based system ensures users only access data and features relevant to their role. No more peeking where you shouldn't!
Regular Security Checks: We'll conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address any potential weaknesses before they become a problem.
These measures create a secure environment for managing sensitive data. You can trust that your information is protected, fostering compliance with data regulations and building trust with users.

This section highlights the system's commitment to accurate, traceable, and accountable data:

Data Double-Checks: Regular data integrity checks will be conducted to catch and prevent any errors or data loss. You can be confident the information you see is reliable.
Going Back in Time: For critical data changes, version control allows us to track modifications and even revert to a previous version if needed.
Keeping a Paper Trail: Audit trails will document all user actions and modifications to sensitive data. This transparency allows for accountability and analysis, ensuring responsible data management.
These measures guarantee the accuracy of the data you rely on for decision-making.  You can trust that the system fosters responsible data practices and adheres to regulatory compliance.
