Non-Functional Requirements for the Food Bank Framework:

1. Performance
    - Under normal network conditions, the system should react to user actions in three seconds or less.
    - Report generation is an example of a batch operation that should finish in a fair amount of time, no more than ten minutes.
    - Scalability: There should be no performance drop when the system can accommodate a 20% increase in the number of concurrent us.

2. Security
    - All sensitive data, including donor information and volunteer profiles, must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    - Role-based access control should be implemented to ensure that users can only access data and functionalities appropriate to their roles.
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

3. Stability
    - The system should have an uptime of at least 99.9%, allowing for scheduled maintenance windows.
    - Automatic backups of all data should be performed daily, with a retention period of at least 30 days.
    - Error handling mechanisms should be in place to gracefully handle unexpected failures and prevent data loss.

4.

5. Data Integrity
    - Data integrity checks should be performed regularly to detect and prevent corruption or loss of data.
	- Version control mechanisms should be implemented to track changes to critical data and allow for rollbacks if necessary.
	- Audit trails should be maintained to track user actions and modifications to sensitive data.
6. Usability
	- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with consistent design patterns and terminology.
	- Accessibility features should be implemented to accommodate users with disabilities.
	- Training materials and documentation should be provided to help users quickly learn how to use the system effectively.
