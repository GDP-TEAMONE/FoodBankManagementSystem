Non-Functional Requirements for the Food Bank Framework:

1. Performance
    - Under normal network conditions, the system should react to user actions in three seconds or less.
    - Report generation is an example of a batch operation that should finish in a fair amount of time, no more than ten minutes.
    - Scalability: There should be no performance drop when the system can accommodate a 20% increase in the number of concurrent us.
     The system must deliver responsiveness and handle increasing user volume effectively:
     Responsiveness: Under normal network conditions, user actions should trigger responses within 3 seconds.
      Report generation: Batch operations like reports should complete within 10 minutes.
      Scalability: Performance should remain stable even with a 20% increase in concurrent users.
      Benefits:
	Fast response times enhance user experience and efficiency.
	Reasonable report generation speeds ensure timely access to valuable insights.
	Scalability accommodates growth and prevents performance bottlenecks.
These requirements guarantee an agile and adaptable system that supports increasing user demands without compromising efficiency.
2. Security
    - All sensitive data, including donor information and volunteer profiles, must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    - Role-based access control should be implemented to ensure that users can only access data and functionalities appropriate to their roles.
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

3. Stability
    - The system should have an uptime of at least 99.9%, allowing for scheduled maintenance windows.
    - Automatic backups of all data should be performed daily, with a retention period of at least 30 days.
    - Error handling mechanisms should be in place to gracefully handle unexpected failures and prevent data loss.

      This system prioritizes high availability and data integrity with the following key requirements:

    - High uptime: Aim for at least 99.9% uptime, allowing for planned maintenance periods.
    - Regular backups: Conduct automatic daily backups of all data, ensuring a retention period of at least 30 days.
    - Robust error handling: Implement mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected failures, preventing data loss and minimizing service disruptions.

Benefits:
    - Minimized downtime ensures consistent availability for food banks and clients.
    - Regular backups safeguard crucial data against failures or accidental deletion.
    - Robust error handling prevents cascading issues and data corruption.
    - These requirements ensure a reliable and resilient food bank management system, minimizing disruptions and safeguarding valuable data.

4. Availability
    - The system should be accessible 24/7 from any location with internet connectivity.
    - Redundant servers and failover mechanisms should be implemented to ensure high availability in the event of hardware or network failures.
    - Emergency procedures should be documented and tested to minimize downtime in case of disasters.

    The system prioritizes uninterrupted service delivery and resilience in case of emergencies:
    - 24/7 accessibility: Users should be able to access the system anytime, anywhere with internet access.
    - High availability: Redundant servers and failover mechanisms ensure service continuity even during hardware or network disruptions.
    - Disaster recovery: Documented and tested emergency procedures minimize downtime in case of major incidents.

Benefits:
    - Constant accessibility empowers food banks and users to manage operations efficiently.
    - Redundancy minimizes service interruptions, ensuring critical data and functionalities remain available.
    - Prepared disaster recovery plans mitigate the impact of unforeseen events, safeguarding system integrity.
    - These requirements guarantee a reliable and responsive system, minimizing disruptions and ensuring continued support for food bank operations.

5. Data Integrity
    - Data integrity checks should be performed regularly to detect and prevent corruption or loss of data.
	- Version control mechanisms should be implemented to track changes to critical data and allow for rollbacks if necessary.
	- Audit trails should be maintained to track user actions and modifications to sensitive data.
6. Usability
	- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with consistent design patterns and terminology.
	- Accessibility features should be implemented to accommodate users with disabilities.
	- Training materials and documentation should be provided to help users quickly learn how to use the system effectively.

7. Scalability
    - The system should be designed to accommodate future growth in both data volume and user base.
    - Performance should remain consistent even as the system scales to handle larger loads of data and more concurrent users.
    - Horizontal and vertical scaling strategies should be evaluated and implemented as needed to meet increasing demands.
