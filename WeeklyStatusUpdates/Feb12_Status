Non-Functional Requirements for the Food Bank Framework:

1. Performance
    - Under normal network conditions, the system should react to user actions in three seconds or less.
    - Report generation is an example of a batch operation that should finish in a fair amount of time, no more than ten minutes.
    - Scalability: There should be no performance drop when the system can accommodate a 20% increase in the number of concurrent us.

2. Security
    - All sensitive data, including donor information and volunteer profiles, must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    - Role-based access control should be implemented to ensure that users can only access data and functionalities appropriate to their roles.
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
