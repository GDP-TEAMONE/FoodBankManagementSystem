Non-Functional Requirements for the Food Bank Framework:

1. Performance
    - Under normal network conditions, the system should react to user actions in three seconds or less.
    - Report generation is an example of a batch operation that should finish in a fair amount of time, no more than ten minutes.
    - Scalability: There should be no performance drop when the system can accommodate a 20% increase in the number of concurrent us
