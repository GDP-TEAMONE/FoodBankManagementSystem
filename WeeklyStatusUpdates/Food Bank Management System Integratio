** Food Bank Management System Integration: **

We've identified five key areas for your food bank management system:
1) User Registration and Profiles: Manage accounts for donors, recipients, volunteers, and administrators, with relevant profile information.
2) Donation Management: Track incoming donations, record details, and manage financial aspects.
3) Inventory Management: Keep accurate records of all food items, including quantities, expiry dates, nutritional information, and allergen data.
4) Volunteer Management: Recruit, track volunteer hours, and assign tasks based on skills and availability.
5) Recipient Registration and Eligibility: Register recipients, verify eligibility, and manage program enrollment.

Now, let's see how these pieces can integrate seamlessly within the food bank management system:

1)  Central User Database:
Create a central database to store user information for all categories (donors, recipients, volunteers, administrators).
Implement different access levels and permissions based on user type.
