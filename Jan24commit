- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To create a effective food bank management system that addresses issues in our current system and hindering our ability to efficiently serve those in need and optimize our impact.We lack comprehensive tools to address below key operational areas.

* Inventory management: Difficulty tracking food donations, expiration dates, and nutritional information, leading to waste or insufficient supply.
* Client needs: Lack of data on client demographics and dietary restrictions, making it hard to personalize food distribution.
* Volunteer coordination: Disconnected communication and scheduling, leading to confusion and inefficiency.
* Donor engagement: Difficulty attracting and retaining donors, resulting in inconsistent food supplies.
* Data analysis: Siloed data making it hard to track progress, measure impact, and optimize
* Limited feedback: We lack a structured mechanism for gathering feedback from recipients and volunteers, hindering improvement and responsiveness.
* Inefficient enrollment: Manual recipient registration and eligibility verification are time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to access barriers.
* Unsynchronized distribution: Distribution planning often operates in silos, with limited visibility into inventory and recipient needs, causing shortages and waste.
* Cumbersome ordering: Manual order processing is slow and error-prone, leading to delays and inaccurate inventory levels.
* Data blind spots: Lack of robust reporting and analytics limits our ability to track progress, measure impact, and make data-driven decisions.
* Limited reach: Lack of mobile accessibility excludes clients without internet access, restricting their ability to register and connect with resources.
* Security concerns: Data security and compliance with regulations are at risk due to outdated systems and manual processes.
* Growth constraints: Our current system lacks scalability, posing challenges as our client base and food donations increase.
* Vulnerability to disruptions: Lack of data backup and recovery procedures leaves us vulnerable to system failures and data loss.


Analyzing Inventory Management module centralized database and food tracking

Things to implement:
* We are planning to use MySql and Mongo Db for the work flow and in creation of table structures.
* Design and creation of Entity relationship models for different departments and food tracking.
* Categorization based on the food types for donor and recipient so that it gets easy to map the things and work effectively.
